# GlobalX
This is a backend server app that converts currency from one country to another. There are currently 5 countries to choose from including: USA, UK, EU, China and Switzerland. Traveling internationally to a strange land can be a nerve wrecking experience sometimes, especially when trying to figure out conversions to pay for things on the spot. This app can be a very useful tool for travelers, people immigrating or seeking refuge to another country. This list of countries will be expanded in the future to include a larger seletion.

To get started download the zip file for this repository and import it into your IDE. Run the application and you will be prompted with questions that will help you calculate the conversion.
